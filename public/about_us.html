			<h1>About us</h1>
			<p>
				From the beginning, Touched By A Paw was instituted with a no-kill policy. While
				the rescued cats might have a number of issues caused by abuse or neglect, I seek
				out a solution for even the most challenging situtations. Cats deemed not adoptable due to behavioral problems might go to a non-working safe farm where they
				are housed in a building, fed, given veterinary care if needed, and can roam in and
				out free. Our vet bills run high at times. On average, Touched By A Paw spends between $7,000 and $8,000 per month to care for strays. Monthly donations and occasional fundraisers fund operational costs. Costs depend on the rescued needs
				such as an leg amputation, an eye removal, burns, broken bones, etc., but we do
				it because these cats deserve to be rescued and live out their lives.
			</p>
			<h6>How can you help?</h6>
			<p>
				Touched By A Paw is currently
				in need of canned and dry cat food, clumping cat litter, trash bags, dish soap, big
				bottles of hand sanitizer, copy paper and paper towels. Other wish list items include: cat treats, toys, baby blankets, fleece
				blankets or material, rubber backed throw
				rugs, cat beds, kitty condos, cat furniture
				and scratching posts. Monetary donations
				are welcomed as well.
